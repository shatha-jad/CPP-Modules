The assignment is focused on implementing interfaces using pure abstract classes and creating concrete classes that adhere to those interfaces. Here's an explanation of the assignment:

**AMateria Class:**

The `AMateria` class is a pure abstract class that represents a generic materia. It has protected and public members as specified in the exercise. The class contains a constructor that takes a `std::string` type as a parameter, a member function `getType()` that returns the materia type, a pure virtual function `clone()` that returns a new instance of the same type of materia, and a virtual function `use(ICharacter& target)` that performs an action specific to the type of materia.

**Materias Concrete Classes:**

The exercise requires implementing two concrete classes, `Ice` and `Cure`, which inherit from `AMateria`. The types of these classes are set to "ice" and "cure" respectively. The `clone()` function in each class creates a new instance of the same type of materia, and the `use(ICharacter& target)` function displays a specific message based on the type of materia and the target character.

**ICharacter Interface:**

The `ICharacter` class represents the interface for a character. It is a pure abstract class that defines the methods that need to be implemented by concrete character classes. The interface includes a pure virtual destructor, a `getName()` function that returns the character's name, an `equip(AMateria* m)` function to equip a materia to the character, an `unequip(int idx)` function to unequip a materia at a specified index, and a `use(int idx, ICharacter& target)` function to use a materia at a specified index on a target character.

**Character Concrete Class:**

The `Character` class is a concrete class that implements the `ICharacter` interface. It represents a character with an inventory of 4 slots for materias. The character's inventory starts empty, and materias are equipped in the first empty slot found. The character can unequip a materia at a specified index, use a materia on a target character, and the inventory handling is done based on the given requirements.

**IMateriaSource Interface:**

The `IMateriaSource` class represents the interface for a materia source. It is a pure abstract class that defines the methods that need to be implemented by concrete materia source classes. The interface includes a pure virtual destructor, a `learnMateria(AMateria*)` function to learn and store a materia for cloning, and a `createMateria(std::string const& type)` function to create a new materia of a specified type based on the learned materias.

**MateriaSource Concrete Class:**

The `MateriaSource` class is a concrete class that implements the `IMateriaSource` interface. It represents a source of materias that can learn and store up to 4 different types of materias. The learned materias can be cloned later, and a new materia can be created based on a specified type.

The `main()` function provided in the exercise demonstrates the usage of these classes, where materias are learned, characters are created, materias are equipped and used, and memory is deallocated properly.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the classes as described, ensuring adherence to the Orthodox Canonical Form and C++98 standards. Additionally, you are encouraged to implement and turn in more tests than the ones given in the exercise to further validate the functionality of your code.
