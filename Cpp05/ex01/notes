In this exercise, we are implementing the Form class, which represents a form that can be signed by a Bureaucrat. Here's an explanation of the implementation:

- In the Form.hpp file, we define the Form class. It has private member variables for the name of the form, whether it is signed, and the grades required to sign and execute the form.

- Inside the Form class, we also define two exception classes: GradeTooHighException and GradeTooLowException. These exceptions will be thrown if the form's grade is out of bounds.

- The Form class has a constructor that takes the name of the form and the required grades to sign and execute it. It checks if the grades are within the valid range and throws the appropriate exception if not.

- The Form class also has a copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor.

- We provide getter functions for the form's name, signed status, and the required grades.

- The beSigned() function takes a Bureaucrat object as a parameter and changes the signed status of the form if the bureaucrat's grade is high enough to sign it. If the grade is too low, it throws a GradeTooLowException.

- We overload the << operator to allow printing the form's information in a desired format.

- In the Form.cpp file, we implement the constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor, getter functions, beSigned() function, and the << operator overload.

- The << operator overload prints the form's name, signed status, and the required grades.

By following the Orthodox Canonical Form, we ensure that the class is properly designed, with the appropriate constructors, destructor, and member functions. The implementation adheres to C++98 standards, using the necessary exception handling and providing the required functionality for the Form class.
