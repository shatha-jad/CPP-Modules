Sure! In this task, we are implementing the `Intern` class. The `Intern` class represents an intern who can create different forms based on given parameters.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- In the `Intern` class, we have the default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, and copy assignment operator. These are necessary to properly manage the memory and ensure correct behavior when creating and copying `Intern` objects.

- The `makeForm` function is the key function in the `Intern` class. It takes two parameters: `formName` and `target`. The `formName` parameter specifies the name of the form to be created, and the `target` parameter specifies the target of the form.

- Inside the `makeForm` function, we use if-else statements to determine the type of form to create based on the `formName` parameter. If the `formName` matches one of the known form names ("shrubbery creation", "robotomy request", or "presidential pardon"), we create the corresponding form object using `new` and pass the `target` parameter to the form's constructor.

- After creating the form object, we print a message indicating that the intern has created the form by accessing the form's `getName` function.

- If the `formName` parameter doesn't match any known form names, we print an error message indicating that the form name is unknown.

- Finally, we return the created form object. If the `formName` was unknown and no form object was created, we return `nullptr`.

The `Intern` class encapsulates the responsibility of creating different forms based on the given parameters. It provides a cleaner and more organized way to create forms without using a long series of if-else statements. By implementing the `makeForm` function in the `Intern` class, we can easily extend the functionality to support additional forms in the future.

Remember to test the functionality of the `Intern` class by creating different forms and verifying that the correct forms are created based on the provided parameters.



In this main.cpp, we create an instance of the Intern class and use it to create different forms. We call the makeForm function of the Intern class with different form names and targets to create specific forms.

We check if the form creation was successful by verifying that the returned pointer is not null. If the form is created successfully, we print a message indicating the name of the form created. After that, we delete the created form to free the memory.

In the last part, we demonstrate the case where an unknown form name is provided. The makeForm function returns a null pointer in this case, and we print an "Unknown form name" message.

Make sure to include the necessary header files for the Intern class and the different form classes (Form, ShrubberyCreationForm, RobotomyRequestForm, PresidentialPardonForm) to compile the code successfully.
