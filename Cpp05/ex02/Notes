In this exercise, we are implementing concrete classes derived from the abstract class `AForm`, which represents a generic form. The concrete classes include `ShrubberyCreationForm`, `RobotomyRequestForm`, and `PresidentialPardonForm`. 

1. `AForm` (formerly `Form`) is an abstract class that encapsulates common attributes and behaviors of all forms. It has private data members such as `name`, `isSigned`, `gradeToSign`, and `gradeToExecute`. It provides getters for these attributes and a `beSigned` function to sign the form. It also declares a pure virtual function `execute` that must be implemented by derived classes.

2. `ShrubberyCreationForm` is a concrete form that represents a form for creating shrubbery. It inherits from `AForm` and adds a private member `target` to store the target location. The `execute` function is implemented to create a file named `<target>_shrubbery` and write ASCII trees into it.

3. `RobotomyRequestForm` is a concrete form that represents a form for robotomy requests. It inherits from `AForm` and adds a private member `target` to store the target of the robotomy. The `execute` function is implemented to simulate a robotomy procedure by producing drilling noises and randomly determining the success of the robotomy.

4. `PresidentialPardonForm` is a concrete form that represents a form for presidential pardons. It inherits from `AForm` and adds a private member `target` to store the target of the pardon. The `execute` function is implemented to inform that the target has been pardoned by Zaphod Beeblebrox.

Each concrete class has its own constructor to initialize the necessary attributes, and they override the `execute` function from the base class to provide their specific implementation.

The `main.cpp` file is responsible for creating instances of different forms, interacting with bureaucrats, and executing the forms using the `executeForm` member function of the `Bureaucrat` class. It demonstrates the usage of the form classes and their interactions with bureaucrats.

It's important to adhere to the canonical Orthodox form and C++98 guidelines, which include proper naming conventions, function declarations, and other coding standards.
